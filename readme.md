# Tanim the Script

A simple script to render typst and make animations. Checkout <https://github.com/liquidhelium/tanim> for a simlilar
program that does the same thing. (spoiler: it is less flexible in terms of data flow but it runs much faster)

# Quick start

1. Download the required assets via `./download_assets.sh`.
2. Render the animation via `./tanim.sh`. You can run the script with `--help` to see more details.

Note that sometimes you might want to specify the `--cookies` argument in case if YouTube blocks
you from downloading the audio.
All the dependencies are listed out in <./shell.nix>.
